## 📖 What this project does  
Turns the HW 05 basketball court into a **playable 3‑D shooting game**:

* Physics‑based ball (gravity, bounces, rim & backboard hits)  
* Keyboard controls (move, set power, shoot, reset, orbit camera)  
* Strict scoring – only counts when the ball **falls through** the hoop  
* Rotation animation on the ball  
* Live UI: score, attempts, makes, accuracy, power bar  
* Instant feedback — “**SHOT MADE!**” / “**MISSED SHOT**”, rim & scoreboard flash
**Bonus:**  
  - Multiple hoops logic  
  - Aim% display (how close the shot was to the hoop center)
